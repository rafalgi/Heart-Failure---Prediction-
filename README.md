# Heart Failure Prediction
Model Heart Failure - Prediction 

The Heart Failure - Prediction model was created using XGBoost technology, a powerful machine learning tool. Utilizing a dataset containing information on various risk factors associated with heart failure, this model was trained to predict the risk of heart failure occurrence in patients. The application was implemented using Flask, a microframework in Python, enabling an easy-to-use user interface to interact with the model through a web browser. With this solution, users can quickly and easily check their risk of heart failure, which can aid in early detection and prevention of this serious condition
